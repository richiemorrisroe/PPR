After paying some money, I got a sample of geocoded houses.

- We can read in his data and get a big head start

- only covers 2012-17

- but has latitude and longitude, and shapefiles, which will help a lot.

* First Article
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
It is a truth universally acknowledged that a married man in
possession of a good fortune must be in want of a house.
#+END_QUOTE

I've taken the liberty of updating good old Jane's statement for more
contemporary times. This article talks about my process of looking at
and understanding property prices in Ireland.

Some background for my non-Irish readers:
- Ireland was mostly poor from the 1930's to the 1990's
- Banks were very hesitant to lend money to anyone
- And the interest rates were very high

This all changed during the Celtic Tiger period, when a flood of cheap
euro-denominated money was dropped in by German and french
helicopters [fn:1]. This lead (predictably) to a massive property
bubble, which was sadly interrupted by the advent of financial
contagion in 2007. Over the next few years, the economy fell apart, we
were dragged into a bailout program, and house prices collapsed.

A few years after that, they started to recover, and right now, we
have a massive housing crisis in that people can't afford houses,
which puts more stress on the rental market, increasing prices.

Given that I don't trust the property-porn engaged in by the media and
government, I decided to take matters into my own hands, and consult
the property price register (PPR for future reference) and figure out
whether or not I should buy or continue to slum it in a hell of
short-term lets and fear [fn:2].

** Property Price Register

So, the property price register was established in the depths of the
economic crisis [fn:3], and so has a number of problems. The most
obvious is that we only have data from 2010. Given data from the boom,
it would be a much easier task to estimate tops and bottoms, but we
can only work with what we have. The second problem with the data is
that Ireland doesn't have postcodes [fn:4], which makes localisation
of the properties a challenge.

Nonetheless, the nice people at the [[https://www.propertypriceregister.ie/website/npsra/pprweb.nsf/page/ppr-home-en][PPR]] have collated the data for us,
so there is that. They helpfully provide the data in CSV format, and
have a document which contains all of the property data, which can be
found [[https://propertypriceregister.ie/website/npsra/pprweb.nsf/PPRDownloads?OpenForm][here]] [fn:5]


So, on with the show! [fn:6]

*** Data Cleaning

In data analysis, much as in life, cleaning is important.
Unfortunately, while keeping ones house and body cleaning rarely takes
up all of one's time, data cleaning, can,  and often does take up almost all
of the time. So, enjoying (or at least not hating) this process,
is an important career skill.

Anyways, so the first thing we do is look at the data

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session *R* :exports both
dat <- read_excel("PPR-ALL.xlsx", sheet="PPR-ALL")
names(dat)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| Date of Sale (dd/mm/yyyy) |
| Address                   |
| Postal Code               |
| County                    |
| Price (�)                 |
| Not Full Market Price     |
| VAT Exclusive             |
| Description of Property   |
| Property Size Description |

OK, so we have date (nicely, they have specified the format),
address, postal code, county.

Note that price has a weirdass character
in there. This is probably because I don't really understand how
encodings work [fn:21].

I have some problems with these names. The spaces will cause problems,
and capitalisation is so passe. I'll fix these problems with some
code.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :exports code
normalise_names <- function(df) {
    nms <- names(df)
    normed <- iconv(
        tolower(
            gsub("([[:space:]]|[[:punct:]])+", "_",
                 x=nms)),
        "latin1", "ASCII", sub="")
    drop_usc <- gsub("([a-z_])_*$", "\\1",
                     x=normed)
    names(df) <- drop_usc
    df
}
#+END_SRC


This function does a few things:
1) it replaces spaces or punctuation with underscores[fn:22]
2) it then converts all text to lowercase 
3) Then we exert cultural imperialism and export to ascii[fn:24]
4) finally, we replace multiple underscores with one (for tidyness, mostly)

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :exports both 
dat2 <- normalise_names(dat)
names(dat2)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| date_of_sale_dd_mm_yyyy   |
| address                   |
| postal_code               |
| county                    |
| price                     |
| not_full_market_price     |
| vat_exclusive             |
| description_of_property   |
| property_size_description |

Much better. Little things like this add up to a better, more
productive life.

Next, we need to remove the Euro symbols from the input doc (which
have become hopelessly mangled). Again, we abuse iconv, this time on
a particular column. My life would be much easier if I took the time
to learn how to handle encodings [fn:7]

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session *R* :exports code
fix_price <- function(x) {
    nopunct <- gsub(",|\\.", "", x=x)
    nums <- iconv(nopunct, "latin1", "ASCII", sub="")
}
dat2$price <- with(dat2, fix_price(price))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: TRUE


- For some bizzare reason, price is in cent. We handle that here to avoid wasting time. 
- These preliminaries accomplished, we can move towards actually looking at the data

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :exports code :results none

prop_df <- dat2 %>%
    mutate(date_of_sale=lubridate::dmy(date_of_sale_dd_mm_yyyy),
           not_full_market_price=as.factor(not_full_market_price),
           postal_code=as.factor(fct_explicit_na(postal_code)),
           vat_exclusive=as.factor(vat_exclusive),
           county=as.factor(county),
           price=as.numeric(price)/100)
prop_df2 <- mutate(prop_df,
                   year=lubridate::year(date_of_sale),
                   month=lubridate::month(date_of_sale),
                   day=lubridate::day(date_of_sale))

prop_sample <- sample_frac(prop_df2, size=0.1)
#+END_SRC

- We also take a ten percent sample, just to speed up the analysis [fn:8]

#+RESULTS:

*** Wasting Time with Plots

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results output graphics :file pricedens.png :exports results
ggplot(prop_df, aes(x=price))+geom_density()
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:pricedens.png]]

- So, when we do the simplest plot ever (a one-way summary of price),
  it looks pretty weird.
- Most of the density is in the one line near zero, and there's a
  long tail that goes up to 100mn
- who are these people buying houses for many millions of euros?
- most importantly, how can I become one of them? 

The first thing to do when you find something weird like this is to
take a look at the observations and see if they are different [fn:9].
Let's sort the data by price and look at the addresses.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :colnames yes :exports both
arrange(prop_df, desc(price)) %>%
    select(address, county, date_of_sale, price) %>%
    head()
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| address                                       | county | date_of_sale |     price |
|-----------------------------------------------+--------+--------------+-----------|
| 2 CANNON HOUSE, CLANCY QUAY, DUBLIN 8         | Dublin |   2018-06-22 | 139165000 |
| APT 204 THE ALLIANCE, THE GASWORKS, BARROW ST | Dublin |   2018-06-22 |  87928183 |
| Block F  K and L Central Park, Leopardstown   | Dublin |   2014-07-24 |  86365000 |
| Blocks F  K and L Central Park, Leopardstown  | Dublin |   2014-03-28 |  70503358 |
| 182 THE ELYSIAN, EGLINTON STREET, CORK        | Cork   |   2018-07-27 |  69873482 |
| Binary Hub  Roe's Lane, Bonham Street         | Dublin |   2016-12-19 |  69208163 |

OK, so the Cannon house thing must be more than one apartment. Otherwise things have gone even
madder than I thought. Also Apt 204 the Alliance, and 182 the Elysian [fn:10]. Entire 
apartment blocks for 76-86 million makes more sense, however.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :colnames yes :exports both
arrange(prop_df, desc(price)) %>%
    select(address, county, date_of_sale, price) %>%
    tail()
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| address                                  | county    | date_of_sale | price |
|------------------------------------------+-----------+--------------+-------|
| 7 Greenfields, Lanesboro Road, Roscommon | Roscommon |   2015-05-22 |  5179 |
| 8 Greenfields, Lanesboro Road, Roscommon | Roscommon |   2015-05-22 |  5179 |
| 9 Greenfields, Lanesboro Road, Roscommon | Roscommon |   2015-05-22 |  5179 |
| LAVALLY, BALLINTOGHER                    | Sligo     |   2014-05-01 |  5177 |
| Loghnabradden, Fintown, Co. Donegal      | Donegal   |   2012-01-11 |  5079 |
| CLOGHAN, GLENCOLMCILLE, DONEGAL          | Donegal   |   2014-07-18 |  5079 |


- there must be something really wrong with these houses.

It does tell us something about the tails[fn:11] of the crash, in that
property was worth so little in Roscommon in 2015 that this happened.
It may also be an error, as I don't know what kind of checking goes into 
this data. 

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results output graphics :file countyearly.png :exports results
year2 <- prop_df2 %>% group_by(year) %>% summarise(count=n())
ggplot(year2, aes(x=year, y=count))+geom_line()
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:countyearly.png]]
- Note that 2018 hasn't finished yet, which distorts the trend.

However, it's interesting to note that there weren't that many sales.
Even at 55k it's only 5% of the housing stock [fn:12]. That's not a huge amount,
but given the lack of data for the boom, it's very difficult to make those judgements. 

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results output graphics :file yearly.png :exports results
countyear <- prop_df2 %>%
    filter(price<2e6)  %>%
    group_by(year, county) %>%
    summarise(count=n(),
              med=median(price),
              mean=mean(price))
ggplot(countyear, aes(x=year, y=med, colour=county))+
    geom_line()+
    scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::dollar_format(prefix="€" ))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:yearly.png]]

[[file:yearly.png]]

So the overall trend is pretty clear. The chart above shows median prices.
For those of you who aren't stats nerds, the median is the middle value.
If you laid out all the prices in a line, the median would be the middle of 
the line. This means that it's a reasonable summary of the distribution. 

Really, you should look at the distribution itself, but aggregations
such as the median are useful for plots and telling people about. 


#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results output graphics :file meanyearly.png :exports results
ggplot(countyear, aes(x=year, y=mean, colour=county))+geom_line()+scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::dollar_format(prefix="€" ))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:meanyearly.png]]
- The mean, which is the sum divided by the length of the set of numbers is much higher.
This is pretty normal in most sets of data because huge values at the top or bottom
have more impact on the mean. Again, the same trend is pretty visible.

Note that I've filtered out the properties sold for more than 2mn, as these are mostly apartment
blocks and groups of houses. These probably shouldn't be looked at for this analysis [fn:13]. 

Looking closer at Dublin (and breaking down by postal code), we can see some more interesting patterns. 

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session  :results output graphics :file dubmonthly.png :exports results
filter(prop_df, county=="Dublin", price<1e6, 
county==str_match(county, "^Dublin")) %>%
    ggplot( aes(x=date_of_sale, y=price))+
    geom_point()+
    facet_wrap(~postal_code)+
    geom_smooth()
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:dubmonthly.png]]
- Prices are definitely trending up, but there are some large outliers
  across the board.

Like this former house owned by an executive in [[https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/homes-and-property/new-to-market/where-the-gardens-sweep-down-to-the-liffey-1.2650733][Dublin 20, for
example]]. That place definitely doesn't reflect the average experience
in that area. In general, I'm beginning to think that there are
multiple housing markets in Ireland, not one. This makes sense as one
can only compete against others in the same price range. This would
suggest that I should regard the house buying denizens of South Dublin
to be some kind of alien species. I do enjoy when a data-driven theory
agrees with my priors.


#+BEGIN_SRC R  :session  :results output graphics :file dubsalesdaily.png :exports results
avbyday <- filter(prop_df, price<2e6, county=="Dublin") %>% group_by(date_of_sale, postal_code) %>% summarise(med_price=median(price), sales=n(), min_price=min(price), max_price=max(price), var_price=var(price), mean_price=mean(price))
ggplot(avbyday, aes(x=date_of_sale, y=sales))+geom_line()+facet_wrap(~postal_code)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:dubsalesdaily.png]]
- Long periods of not much activity, followed by sudden spikes.
- We should probably dig into some of the spikes to figure out what
  they mean.
- It's possible that they may be one overall transaction recorded as
  multiples (for instance, when an entire apartment block is sold to
  one developer, and it's recorded unit by unit).


** Mortgage Data

Most people who buy houses need mortgages, unfortunately. Fortuntately
for me, we have a (reasonably good) source of information in this on
the <INSERT_ORG_HERE> website.

The data goes back to 2011 (so not quite as much as our house price
data), and is collected at a monthly cadence. It appears to be most of
the high-street banks in ireland, and is only for mortgages on residential
properties.

It comes in an Excel sheet. Whoever released this seemed to value the
aesthetic principles of the dataset in preference to usability in
computer programs. Given that the primary audience seems to be
journalists, this probably makes sense.

I did some artisanal data cleaning [fn:14] on the file, and imported
all the data as per below.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results none :exports code
require(readxl)
mortgage_sheets <- excel_sheets("Website-mortgage-approvals-time-series-Sep2018.xls")
volumes <- read_excel("Website-mortgage-approvals-time-series-Sep2018.xls",
                      sheet="Volumes", skip=4)
names(volumes)[c(1:2, 8)] <- c("year", "month", "total")
volumes2 <- normalise_names(volumes)

values <- read_excel("Website-mortgage-approvals-time-series-Sep2018.xls",
                     sheet="Values", skip=4)
names(values)[c(1:2, 8)] <- c("year", "month", "total")
values2 <- normalise_names(values)

av_values <- read_excel("Website-mortgage-approvals-time-series-Sep2018.xls",
                        sheet="Average Value", skip=4)
names(av_values)[c(1:2, 8)] <- c("year", "month", "total")
av_values2 <- normalise_names(av_values)
valtidy <- gather(values2, key="type", value="value", 3:7) %>%
    mutate(date=lubridate::ymd(paste(
                               year, month, "01",
                               sep="-_")))
voltidy <- gather(volumes, key="type", value="volume", 3:7) %>%
    mutate(date=lubridate::ymd(paste(
                               year, month, "01",
                               sep="-_")))
av_valtidy <- gather(av_values2, key="type", value="av_value", 3:7) %>%
    mutate(date=lubridate::ymd(paste(
                               year, month, "01",
                               sep="-_")))
#+END_SRC


Note the repeated code. Sometimes, a little copying is better than a
large dependency. Sometimes people are lazy. Who can ever tell, in
this workaday world?

The volumes tab is count, the values tab is in millions (1e6), and the
average values tab is (presumably) the first divided by the second.
There's also a notes tab, which we don't import [fn:15]

So, below we can see the volumes of mortgage approvals since 2011. 

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session  :results output graphics :file mortgagecount.png :exports results
ggplot(voltidy,
       aes(x=date, y=volume,
           colour=type))+
    geom_line()+
    geom_smooth()
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:mortgagecount.png]] [[file:mortgagecount.png]] The most striking thing
about this graph is the complete absence of first-time buyers between
2011 and 2014. I am tempted to declare it a data mistake, but given
the economic conditions it is a little plausible. They may also
suppress small numbers in the interests of privacy. It would be good
if I figured this out, but I'll leave it for now.

When they do come back, they come back all at once, with near level
FTB and traders-up. If this pattern held for the entirity of the boom,
no wonder that things have gotten so messed up since.

Next, we look at the total value of mortgages issued to particular
kinds of buyers over the time period.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session  :results output graphics :file mortgagevols.png :exports results
ggplot(valtidy, aes(x=dates, y=count*1.e6, colour=type))+
    geom_line()+
    geom_smooth()+
    ylab("total issue value ")+ 
    scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::dollar_format(prefix="€" ))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:mortgagevals.png]]


- So we have been 1-2bn per year for each of the FTB and Mover Purchase categories.

We can see what the average looks like in the plot below. 


#+BEGIN_SRC R :session  :results output graphics :file mortgage_av_vals.png :exports results
ggplot(av_valtidy, aes(x=date, y=av_value, colour=type))+
    geom_line()+
    geom_smooth()+
    ylab("average issue value ")+
    scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::dollar_format(prefix="€" ))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:mortgage_av_vals.png]]


This chart is actually more interesting than either of the previous
two. We can see that the average value given to FTB is significantly
less than that for Mover Purchase. In some sense, this is weird as one
would expect the movers to need less of a mortgage, given the existence 
of their previous property.

Another point that is obvious from the plot is the re-appearence of
remortgaging in terms of value in 2014. Perhaps not coincidentally,
the state emerged from the bailout program in December [[https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/jean-claude-trichet-and-the-irish-bailout-a-timeline-1.1990882][2013 (paywall,
but they have a few free articles)]]. 

Did the recovery in property prices encourage people to re-mortgage?
Did the banks encourage these (presumably wealthy) borrowers?
it's difficult to estbalish this from the data.

Additionally, given that I want to buy a house in Dublin, I'm not sure
how useful the overall figures are. Unfortunately, this is all we have,
which means we probably need more data (don't worry, we'll come back
to the mortgage data eventually [fn:16]).

Next stop, the CSO!

** Residential Prices by Month, Type of Property (HPM06)

The CSO have this arcane windows only application that people 
are supposed to use to get data. Being on Linux, I was SOL until
some kind soul wrote code to access their database through an API.

They use a weird-ass format called JSON-Stat, which I know little
about, but fortunately I can just call a function and get the data
back as a dataframe.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session  :exports both :results none
source("rcso/read_api.R")
prices <- getJSONstat("HPM06")

#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :colnames yes :exports both
head(prices)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| type_of_residential_property          |      month | statistic                                                                 | value |
|---------------------------------------+------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------|
| National - all residential properties | 2005-01-01 | Residential Property Price Index (Base Jan 2005 = 100)                    | 100   |
| National - all residential properties | 2005-01-01 | Percentage Change over 1 month for Residential Property Price Index (%)   | nil   |
| National - all residential properties | 2005-01-01 | Percentage Change over 3 months for Residential Property Price Index (%)  | nil   |
| National - all residential properties | 2005-01-01 | Percentage Change over 12 months for Residential Property Price Index (%) | nil   |
| National - all residential properties | 2005-02-01 | Residential Property Price Index (Base Jan 2005 = 100)                    | 100.8 |
| National - all residential properties | 2005-02-01 | Percentage Change over 1 month for Residential Property Price Index (%)   | 0.8   |

- So the type variable tells us what we are measuring, the statistic defines what the value means.
- This is awkward data to work with, but tidying it up should help.
We'll keep type in the rows, but move all the statistics into their own columns, to facilitate plotting.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results none :exports code
prices2 <- spread(prices, key="statistic", value="value")
prices3 <- normalise_names(prices2)
#+END_SRC

The names are still really long, but at least they don't have spaces anymore. 

The variable we care about here is the index. This is normalised to 2005,
at 100, so we can interpret the graph as the change since then. 

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results output graphics :file prices200518.png :exports results
filter(prices3, type_of_residential_property=="National - all residential properties") %>%
    ggplot(aes(x=lubridate::ymd(month), y=residential_property_price_index_base_jan_2005_100_))+geom_line()
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:prices200518.png]] 

Wow, so overall we're in 2005 again. I remember
telling people not to buy houses around then. 
Mind you I was just bitter because no-one would give me 
a mortgage [fn:17]. 

This kinda scares the hell out of me, but I suspect that
the numbers of houses being sold today are a fraction of those
sold during the boom. 

*** TODO Figure out how to get some data on house prices sales during the boom. :noexport:


Next, we can break this down by county/region. 

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results output graphics :file prices_county200518.png :exports results
filter(prices3, type_of_residential_property!="National - all residential properties") %>%
    ggplot(aes(x=lubridate::ymd(month), y=residential_property_price_index_base_jan_2005_100_))+geom_line()+facet_wrap(~type_of_residential_property)+geom_hline(yintercept=100, colour="red")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:prices_county200518.png]] This plot is really informative on my
hi-res screen, but is unlikely to prove useful 
to any of my readers, so I'll break it down into 
number of plots.

#+BEGIN_SRC  R :session :results output graphics :file dub_areas.png :exports results
national <- c("National - all residential properties",
              "National - apartments",
              "National - houses")
nondub_national <- c("National excluding Dublin - all residential properties",
                     "National excluding Dublin - apartments",
                     "National excluding Dublin - houses")
dublin_ov <- c("Dublin - all residential properties",
                  "Dublin - apartments",
               "Dublin - houses")
dub_areas <- c("Dublin City - houses",
               "Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown - houses",
               "Fingal - houses",
               "South Dublin - houses")
filter(prices3, type_of_residential_property %in% dub_areas) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x=lubridate::ymd(month), y=residential_property_price_index_base_jan_2005_100_))+geom_line()+facet_wrap(~type_of_residential_property)+geom_hline(yintercept=100, colour="red")

One of the big problems with most of the datasets available is that they start during the crash.
This makes it very difficult to accurately estimate any trend. However,
we can get new property prices by year and major area from the department of housing. 
While this isn't perfect, it's better than nothing.

** New Property Prices 

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results none :exports none
newprices <- read_csv("yearly_property_prices.csv", skip=1, na="n/a")
newprices2 <- normalise_names(newprices)
newprices3 <- gather(newprices2, key="area", value="price", 2:8)

#+END_SRC


#+BEGIN_SRC R :session :results output graphics :file yearlyprices.png :exports results
ggplot(newprices3, aes(x=year, y=as.numeric(price), colour=area))+
    geom_line()+
    scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::dollar_format(prefix="€" ))+
    facet_wrap(~area)+ylab("price")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

Wow, this is mental. House prices have basically only gone down a lot once,
and that was the boom. This may be why many Irish people regard property as 
such a good asset. Additionally, we're now seeing ZIRP and QE inject large sums
of money into the economy, which has pumped up asset prices [fn:18]. 

On the other hand, Dublin looked pretty mental in 2015 (when this datasource stops).
Note that this is only for new properties, which is skewed by the scarcity.
I probably need to get some counts to normalise.

Additionally, I need to look at population flows over the time periods concerned.
If I had counts for houses built and available, that would be super useful.
Not sure if such a source exists, however. 

** Pulling it All Together

- So what have we learned from today's excursions? 

Firstly, we reviewed the change in property prices by county and date of sale
from the PPR. This source is entirely comprehensive, but only covers sales,
so we can't figure out demand from this, except by looking at price.
Additionally, the address data is pretty raw, and it would take a whole 
lot of time or cost a whole bunch of money [fn:19] to make it more usable.

If that could be done, the CSO have a lot of good area data which I barely
scratch the surface of here. The most obvious next avenue of approach is
through population statistics and change rates, and this would be expected
to impact demand for housing. 

You could then normalise the data by the population and get more useful 
estimates. 

However, another issue which we're ingoring is rents, as a lot of property 
is not available to be sold. This is becoming increasingly common, especially
in Dublin. I believe that a bunch of the really large transactions in the PPR
are the result of such arrangements. We can get rents from various websites, 
in compliance with all legal processes :) 

Finally, we need to measure the delta between asking and sale prices. Again,
this can be obtained through various web-scraping means and sources. This
delta will then allow us to make somewhat (more) useful decisions with respect to 
property [fn:20]

So, that's what I'm going to do, I guess. To be fair, this post is probably
more like 2-3 articles, but I can't handle not being finished anymore, so 
I'm calling it done.

[fn:18] I am still not sure if this was just accidental, or malicious

[fn:17] we all partied, dontcha know? 

[fn:16] I don't think anyone except me worries about this

[fn:15] but i did in fact read it. Reading any notes provided is a super-power. 

[fn:14] i.e. by hand

[fn:13] yes, this is really subjective, like almost everything in data
analysis. The advantage here is that I provide code so people can
change that however they want

[fn:12] assuming 1mn households. I should probably check this with the
CSO

[fn:11] geddit?

[fn:10] that dude finally made his money back, after opening really
expensive apartments just as the crash hit

[fn:9] or you could just log it and get one with building a CNN I
guess

[fn:8] turns out sampling is pretty cool, who knew? 

[fn:7] look at how well I'm resisting distraction!

[fn:6] for very nerdy, boring values of show

[fn:5] they also provide commercial data (which I just noticed), but I am resisting the urge to become distracted

[fn:4] we do now, but they are not on any of the addresses

[fn:3] by the Greens actually, so at least I don't feel my vote for them was *entirely* wasted

[fn:2] actually I've been in the same house for many years, but I likes a good simile. 

[fn:1] In fact, it was done via banks, but it doesn't really have the same ring to it now, does it?
